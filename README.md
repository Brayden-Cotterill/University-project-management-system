# University-Project-Management-System

## Why did I make this?
This was for my final year project at @Birkbeck. It's in my own repo for archival purpuses

## What is it?

This is a CRUD web application that mainly uses Filament to dynamically manage student projects (dissertations) for HE
courses (i.e University's/Colleges).

This was primarily developed with Laravel, utilising Sail and WSL2. PHP is required.
